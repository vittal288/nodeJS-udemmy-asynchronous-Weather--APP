CALLBACKSTACK IN V8 JS Engine refer the image EventLoopDGM.png

CALLBACK STACK-->NODE API-->CALLBACK QUEUE-->{EventLoop}-->CALLBACK STACK

CALLBACK:
-->We can delete or POP UP the item of piece of code in the top of  CALLBACK stack(it is basically data structure) 
--Or We can add(PUSH) the item to the top of the CALLBACK STACK
-->We cannot remove the bottom item from the stack i.e CALLBACK STACK 
-->CALLBACK stack will execute on line of code at a time 


NODE API:
-->whenever CALLBACK STACK finds the call back function then that piece of code will move NODE API block 
-->Once from NODE API it wait for it delay , once it complets it moves to CALLBACK QUEUE
-->Mean while EventLoop will be monitering the state of CALLBACK STACK to push code from CALLBACK QUEUE to CALLBACK STACK

CALLBACK QUEUE:
CALLBACK QUEUE containt the piece code in its stack which was moved from NODE API.

CALLBACK back code never execute directly from CALLBACK STACK instead it has to go through NODE API-->CALLBACK QUEUE{EventLoop}-->CALLBACK STACK
